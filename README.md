1. Perceptron.ipynb

This python notebook contains code to build a basic perceptron (single neuron).
We will use scikit-learn's linear_model and import Perceptron module.
We will build a very basic neural network model for CLASSIFICATION with one layer and one perceptron
We will then use scikit_learn's iris dataset to fit and test out model.



2. Classification_Sequential.ipynb

This python notebook contains code to build a Neural Network with two hidden layers.
We will use TensorFlow's Keras Sequential API.
Input is Keras fashion_mnist dataset. Images are of 28 x 28 pixels.
We create two hidden layers with relu activation functions.
We create output layer with 10 neurons with softmax activation function
