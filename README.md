1. Perceptron.ipynb


This python notebook contains code to build a basic perceptron (single neuron).
We will use scikit-learn's linear_model and import Perceptron module.
We will build a very basic neural network model for CLASSIFICATION with one layer and one perceptron
We will then use scikit_learn's iris dataset to fit and test out model.
